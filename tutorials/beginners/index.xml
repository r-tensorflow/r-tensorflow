This tutorial provides an example of how to load CSV data from a file into a TensorFlow Dataset using tfdatasets.
The data used in this tutorial are taken from the Titanic passenger list. The model will predict the likelihood a passenger survived based on characteristics like age, gender, ticket class, and wether the person was traveling alone.</description></item><item><title>Loading image data</title><link>/tutorials/beginners/load/load_image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/beginners/load/load_image/</guid><description>Note: this is the R version of this tutorial in the TensorFlow oficial webiste.
This tutorial provides a simple example of how to load an image dataset using tfdatasets.
The dataset used in this example is distributed as directories of images, with one class of image per directory.
Setup library(keras) library(tfdatasets) Retrieve the images Before you start any training, you will need a set of images to teach the network about the new classes you want to recognize.</description></item></channel></rss>
