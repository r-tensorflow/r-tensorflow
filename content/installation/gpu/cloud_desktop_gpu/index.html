<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cloud desktops with various GPU configurations are available from <a href="https://www.paperspace.com/ml">Paperspace</a>. With Paperspace, you can access a full Linux desktop running Ubuntu 16.04 all from within a web browser. An SSH interface is also available, as is a browser based RStudio Server interface (via SSH tunnel).</p>
<p>Paperspace offers an <a href="https://paperspace.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002284433">RStudio TensorFlow template</a> with NVIDIA GPU libraries (CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 6.0) pre-installed, along with the GPU version of TensorFlow v1.4 and the R <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras/">keras</a>, <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/">tfestimators</a>, and <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/">tensorflow</a> packages. Follow the instructions below to get started with using RStudio on Paperspace.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started, sign up for a Paperspace account here: <a href="https://www.paperspace.com/account/signup" class="uri">https://www.paperspace.com/account/signup</a> (you can use the <code>RSTUDIO</code> promo code when you sign up to receive a $5 account credit).</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-signup.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>After you’ve signed up and verified your account email, you will be taken to a <a href="https://www.paperspace.com/console/machine/create">Create Machine</a> page. Here you’ll select various options including your compute region and machine template. You should select the <strong>RStudio</strong> template:</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-machine.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>Be sure to select one of the GPU instances (as opposed to the CPU instances). For example, here we select the P4000 machine type which includes an NVIDIA Quadro P4000 GPU:</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-machine-type.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>After your machine is provisioned (this can take a few minutes) you are ready to access it via a web browser. Hover over the machine in the Paperspace Console and click the “Launch” link:</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-launch.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>After the machine is launched you’ll see your Linux desktop within the browser you launched it from. You may need to use the <em>Scaling Settings</em> to adjust the desktop to a comfortable resolution:</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-scaling.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>You should also change your default password using the <code>passwd</code> utility (your default password should have been sent to you in an email titled “Your new Paperspace Linux machine is ready”):</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-password.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>You now have a Linux desktop equipped ready to use with TensorFlow for R! Go ahead and run RStudio from the application bar:</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-rstudio.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>NVIDIA GPU libraries (CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7) are pre-installed, along with the GPU version of TensorFlow v1.7. The R <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras/">keras</a>, <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/">tfestimators</a>, and <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/">tensorflow</a> packages are also pre-installed, as are all of the packages from the [tidyverse[(<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" class="uri">https://www.tidyverse.org/</a>)] (dplyr, ggplot2, etc.).</p>
<p>An important note about the pre-installed dependencies: Since the NVIDIA CUDA libraries, TensorFlow, and Keras are all pre-installed on the Paperspace instances, you should not use the <code>install_tensorflow()</code> or <code>install_keras()</code> functions, but rather rely on the existing, pre-configured versions of these libraries. Installing or updating other versions of these libraries will likely not work at all!</p>

<div id="automatic-shutdown" class="section level2">
<h2>Automatic Shutdown</h2>
<p>You can set Paperspace machines to automatically shutdown when they have not been used for a set period of time (this is especially important since machine time is billed by the hour). You can access this setting from the Paperspace console for your machine:</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-shutdown.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>Here the auto-shutdown time is set to 1 day, however you can also choose shorter or longer intervals.</p>
</div>
<div id="terminal-access" class="section level2">
<h2>Terminal Access</h2>
<div id="web-terminal" class="section level3">
<h3>Web Terminal</h3>
<p>You can use the <strong>Open Terminal</strong> command on the Paperspace console for your machine to open a web based terminal to your machine:</p>
<p><img src="images/paperspace-web-terminal.png" class="illustration"></p>
<p>You’ll need to login using either the default password emailed to you when you created the machine or to the new password which you subsequently created.</p>
</div>
<div id="ssh-login" class="section level3">
<h3>SSH Login</h3>
<p>You can also login to your Paperspace instance using a standard SSH client. This requires that you first <a href="https://paperspace.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/236362888-Public-IPs">Assign a public IP address</a> to your machine (note that public IP addresses cost an additional $3/month).</p>
<p>Once you have your public IP address, you can SSH into your machine as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1">$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> paperspace@<span class="op">&lt;</span>public IP<span class="op">&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll need to login using either the default password emailed to you when you created the machine or to the new password which you subsequently created.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="rstudio-server" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio Server</h2>
<p>You may prefer using the RStudio Server browser-based interface to the virtual Linux desktop provided by Paperspace (especially when on slower internet connections). This section describes how to access your Paperspace machine using an SSH tunnel.</p>
<p>To start with, follow the instructions for <a href="#ssh-login">SSH Login</a> immediately above and ensure that you can login to your machine remotely via SSH.</p>
<p>Once you’ve verified this, you should also be able to setup an SSH tunnel to RStudio Server as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> -N -L 8787:127.0.0.1:8787 paperspace@<span class="op">&lt;</span>public-ip<span class="op">&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can access RStudio Server by navigating to port 8787 on your local machine and logging in using the <code>paperspace</code> account and either the default password emailed to you when you created the machine or to the new password which you subsequently created.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8787" class="uri">http://localhost:8787</a></p>
