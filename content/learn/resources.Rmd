You’ll learn from more than 30 code examples that include detailed commentary and practical recommendations. You don’t need previous experience with machine learning or deep learning: this book covers from scratch all the necessary basics. You don’t need an advanced mathematics background, either—high school level mathematics should suffice in order to follow along. |
