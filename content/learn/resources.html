<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X"><strong>Deep Learning with R</strong></a> <br>Deep Learning with R is meant for statisticians, analysts, engineers, and students with a reasonable amount of R experience but no significant knowledge of machine learning and deep learning. You’ll learn from more than 30 code examples that include detailed commentary and practical recommendations. You don’t need previous experience with machine learning or deep learning: this book covers from scratch all the necessary basics. You don’t need an advanced mathematics background, either—high school level mathematics should suffice in order to follow along.</td>
