# 'X' and 'Y' are placeholders for input data, output data.
# We'll fit a regression model using 3 predictors, so our
# input matrix 'X' will have three columns.
p <- 3L
X <- tf$placeholder("float", shape = shape(NULL, p), name = "x-data")
Y <- tf$placeholder("float", name = "y-data")

# Define the weights for each column in X. Since we will
# have 3 predictors, our 'W' matrix of coefficients will
# have 3 elements. We use a 3 x 1 matrix here, rather than
# a vector, to ensure TensorFlow understands how to perform
# matrix multiplication on 'W' and 'X'.
W <- tf$Variable(tf$zeros(list(p, 1L)))
b <- tf$Variable(tf$zeros(list(1L)))

# Define the model (how estimates of 'Y' are produced)
Y_hat <- tf$add(tf$matmul(X, W), b)

# Define the cost function.
# We seek to minimize the mean-squared error.
cost <- tf$reduce_mean(tf$square(Y_hat - Y))

# Define the mechanism used to optimize the loss function.
# Although normally we'd just use ordinary least squares,
# we'll instead use a gradient descent optimizer (since, in
# a more typical learning situation, we won't have an easy
# mechanism for directly computing the values of coefficients)
generator <- tf$train$GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate = 0.01)
optimizer <- generator$minimize(cost)

# Initialize a TensorFlow session for our regression.

session <- tf$Session()

# Generate some data. The 'true' model will be 'y = 2x + 1';
# that is, the 'slope' parameter is '2', and the intercept is '1'.
# The variable 'y' will only be associated with the first variable;
# the other two variables are just noise.

y <- matrix(2 * x[, 1] + 1 + (rnorm(n, sd = 0.25)))

# Repeatedly run optimizer until the cost is no longer changing.
# (We can take advantage of this since we're using gradient descent
# as our optimizer)
