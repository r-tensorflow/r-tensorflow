<p>In this section you will find tutorials that can be used to get started with TensorFlow for R or, for more advanced users, to discover best practices for loading data, building complex models and solving common problems.</p>
<p>The best place to get started with TensorFlow is using Keras - a Deep Learning API
created by François Chollet. Keras is easy to get started, and it allows you to progressively
build more complex workflows as you need to use advanced models and techniques.</p>
<div id="for-beginners" class="section level2">
<h2>For beginners</h2>
<p>We recommend the following tutorials for you first contact with TensorFlow.
Feel free to navigate trought the ‘beginner’ section in the sidebar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickstart: the minimal getting start guide to Keras.</li>
<li>Basic ML with Keras: use Keras to solve basic Machine Learning tasks.</li>
<li>Load data: learn to efficiently load data to TensorFlow using <code>tfdatasets</code>.</li>
</ul>
