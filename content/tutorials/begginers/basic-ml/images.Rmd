In this section you will find tutorials that can be used to get started with TensorFlow for R or, for more advanced users, to discover best practices for loading data, building complex models and solving common problems.

The best place to get started with TensorFlow is using Keras - a Deep Learning API
created by Fran√ßois Chollet. Keras is easy to get started, and it allows you to progressively 
build more complex workflows as you need to use advanced models and techniques. 

## For beginners

We recommend the following tutorials for you first contact with TensorFlow. 
Feel free to navigate trought the 'beginner' section in the sidebar.

* Quickstart: the minimal getting start guide to Keras.
* Basic ML with Keras: use Keras to solve basic Machine Learning tasks.
* Load data: learn to efficiently load data to TensorFlow using `tfdatasets`.

## For experts

* Advanced Quickstart: learn the subclassing API and how create custom loops.
* Customization: build custom layers and training loops in TensorFlow.
* Distributed Training: distribute your model training acrros multiples GPU's or machines.
