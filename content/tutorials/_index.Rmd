The core TensorFlow API is composed of a set of Python modules that enable constructing 
and executing TensorFlow graphs. The [tensorflow](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow) 
package provides access to the complete TensorFlow API from within R.

The [r-tensorflow](https://github.com/r-tensorflow) project maintains additional R 
packages providing user-friedly interfaces to TensorFlow for the R users.

1. [keras](https://github.com/rstudio/keras) - TensorFlow’s high-level APIs are based on the Keras API standard for defining and training 
neural networks. Keras enables fast prototyping, state-of-the-art research, and 
production—all with user-friendly APIs. The [keras](https://github.com/rstudio/keras) 
R package wraps the `tf.keras` module in an R usual way.

1. [tfdatasets](https://github.com/rstudio/tfdatasets) - The `tf.data` API enables building 
complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. The [tfdatasets](https://github.com/rstudio/tfdatasets) package allow R users to build
data input pipelines directly from R at the same time taking advantage of TensorFlow's 
performance.
