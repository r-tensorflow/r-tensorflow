<p>In this section you will find tutorials that can be used to get started with TensorFlow for R or, for more advanced users, to discover best practices for loading data, building complex models and solving common problems.</p>
<p>The best place to get started with TensorFlow is using Keras - a Deep Learning API
created by François Chollet and ported to R by JJ Allaire. Keras makes it easy to get started, and it allows you to progressively
build more complex workflows as you need to use advanced models and techniques.</p>
