In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy a TensorFlow model using a [plumber API](https://www.rplumber.io/).

In this example we will build an endpoint that takes `POST` requests sending images containing handwritten digits and returning the predicted number.

## Building the model

The first thing we are going to do is to build our model. W
We will use the Keras API to build this model.

We will use the MNIST dataset to build our model.

```{r}
library(keras)
library(tensorflow)
mnist <- dataset_mnist()

mnist$train$x <- (mnist$train$x/255) %>% 
  array_reshape(., dim = c(dim(.), 1))

mnist$test$x <- (mnist$test$x/255) %>% 
  array_reshape(., dim = c(dim(.), 1))

```

Now, we are going to define our Keras model, it will be a simple convolutional neural 
network.

```{r}
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 16, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2,2)) %>% 
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 16, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2,2)) %>% 
  layer_flatten() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = "softmax")

model %>% 
  compile(
    loss = "sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    optimizer = "adam",
    metrics = "accuracy"
  )
```

Next, we fit the model using the MNIST dataset:

```{r}
model %>% 
  fit(
    x = mnist$train$x, y = mnist$train$y,
    batch_size = 32,
    epochs = 5,
    validation_sample = 0.2,
    verbose = 2
  )
```

When we are happy with our model accuracy in the validation dataset we can `evaluate` 
the results on the test dataset with:

```{r}
model %>% evaluate(x = mnist$test$x, y = mnist$test$y)
```

OK, we have 99% accuracy on the test dataset and we want to deploy that model.
First, let's save the model in the `SavedModel` format using:

```{r}
save_model_tf(model, "cnn-mnist")
```

With the model built and saved we can now start building our plumber API file.

## Plumber API

A plumber API is defined by a `.R` file with a few annotations. Here's is how we can write our `api.R` file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(keras)

model <- load_model_tf("cnn-mnist/")

#* Predicts the number in an image
#* @param enc a base64  encoded 28x28 image
#* @post /cnn-mnist
function(enc) {
  # decode and read the jpeg image
  img <- jpeg::readJPEG(source = base64enc::base64decode(enc))
  
  # reshape
  img <- img %>% 
    array_reshape(., dim = c(1, dim(.), 1))
  
  # make the prediction
  predict_classes(model, img)
}
```


Make sure to have the your SavedModel in the same folder as `api.R` and call:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- plumber::plumb("api.R")
p$run(port = 8000)
```

You can now make requests to the [http://lcoalhost:8000/cnn-minist/](http://lcoalhost:8000/cnn-minist/) endpoint. For example, let's verify we can make a POST request to the API sending the first image from the test set:

```{r}
img <- mnist$test$x[1,,,]
mnist$test$y[1]
```

First let's encode the image:

```{r}
encoded_img <- img %>% 
  jpeg::writeJPEG() %>% 
  base64enc::base64encode()
encoded_img
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
req <- httr::POST("http://localhost:8000/cnn-mnist",
           body = list(enc = encoded_img), 
           encode = "json")
httr::content(req)
```

```
[[1]]
[1] 7
```

You can also access the Swagger interface by accessing [http://127.0.0.1:8000/__swagger__/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/__swagger__/) and paste the encoded string in the UI to visualize the result.

## More advanced models

When building more advanced models you may not be able to save the entire model using the `save_model_tf` function. In this case you can use the `save_model_weights_tf` function. 

For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
save_model_weights_tf(model, " cnn-model-weights")
```

Then, in the `api.R` file whenn loading the model you will need to rebuild the model using the exact same code that you used when training and saving and then use `load_model_weights_tf` to load
the model weights.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 16, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2,2)) %>% 
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 16, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2,2)) %>% 
  layer_flatten() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = "softmax")

load_model_weights_tf(model, "cnn-model-weights")
```

## Hosting the plumber API

Plumber is very flexible and allows multiple hosting options. See the plumber [Hostinng documentation](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/hosting.html) for more information.
